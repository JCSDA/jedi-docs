OOPS
####

OOPS is the **Object Oriented Prediction System**.

It is the top level of JEDI that orchestrates the configuration and execution of applications.  This is where most DA applications are implemented.  OOPs also includes the Lorenz 95 and Quasi-geostrophic toy models that can used to run many of the DA applications.

These documents give a high-level overview of the OOPS code repository.  `A low-level description of the classes, functions, and subroutines is also available <http://data.jcsda.org/doxygen/Release/1.0/oops/index.html>`_, produced by means of the `Doxygen document generator <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
