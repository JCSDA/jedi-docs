Sea-ice, Ocean, and Coupled Assimilation (SOCA) is the interface between the generic components of
the JEDI system and MOM6. MOM6 is developed by NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL).

These documents give a high-level overview of the SOCA code repository.  A low-level description of
the classes, functions, and subroutines is also available, produced by means of the
`Doxygen document generator <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
