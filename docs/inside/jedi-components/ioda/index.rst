IODA is the **Interface for Observational Data Access**.  This is the component of JEDI that ingests and processes observational data for use with other JEDI components.


These documents give a high-level overview of the IODA code repository.  A low-level description of the classes, functions, and subroutines is also available, produced by means of the `Doxygen document generator <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
