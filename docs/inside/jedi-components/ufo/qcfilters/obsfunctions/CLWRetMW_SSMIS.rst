CLWRetMW_SSMIS
============================================

Using channels 12-18 of SSMIS satellite brightness temperatures, retrieve cloud liquid water as
described by the references listed below.  This follows a similar routine in GSI Observer.

Required yaml parameters:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ch19h
  channel number of brightness temperature from 19GHz **horizontal** polarized channel

ch19v
  channel number of brightness temperature from 19GHz **vertical** polarized channel

ch22v
  channel number of brightness temperature from 22GHz **vertical** polarized channel

ch37h
  channel number of brightness temperature from 37GHz **horizontal** polarized channel

ch37v
  channel number of brightness temperature from 37GHz **vertical** polarized channel

ch91v
  channel number of brightness temperature from 91GHz **vertical** polarized channel

ch91h
  channel number of brightness temperature from 91GHz **horizontal** polarized channel

Example configuration:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   - filter: Bounds Check
     filter variables:
     - name: brightness_temperature
       channels: 12-18
     test variables:
     - name: CLWRetMW_SSMIS@ObsFunction
       options:
         satellite: SSMIS
         ch19h: 12
         ch19v: 13
         ch22v: 14
         ch37h: 15
         ch37v: 16
         ch91v: 17
         ch91h: 18
         varGroup: ObsValue
     minvalue: 0.0
     maxvalue: 2.0

In this example, any retrieved cloud liquid water value less than zero or greater than 2
will cause the observation to be rejected.
