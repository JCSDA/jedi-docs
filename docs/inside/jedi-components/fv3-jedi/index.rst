FV3-JEDI
########

FV3-JEDI is the interface between the generic components of the JEDI system and models that are
based on the FV3 (Finite Volume Cubed-Sphere) dynamical core. FV3 is developed by NOAA's Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and is used in NOAA's Global Forecast System (GFS) and NASA's
Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS).

These documents give a high-level overview of the FV3-JEDI code repository.  A low-level description of the classes, functions, and subroutines is also available, produced by means of the `Doxygen document generator <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
