MPAS-JEDI
#########

MPAS-JEDI is the interface between the generic components of the JEDI system and the atmospheric core of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS). The primary development partners for MPAS are Los Alamos National Laboratory (COSIM) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

These documents give a high-level overview of the MPAS-JEDI code repository.  `A low-level description of the classes, functions, and subroutines is also available <http://data.jcsda.org/doxygen/Release/1.0/mpasjedi/index.html>`_, produced by means of the `Doxygen document generator <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_.
