Document your code
==================

A best practice is to enable the developers themselves to write the technical documentation, subject to review by other developers.  This helps to ensure that the documentation is accurate, thorough, and up to date.

All JEDI developers are asked to document the code that they add in order to help others understand what has been done and how to use any new features that may have been added.

There are two principle mechanisms for documenting code in JEDI.

1. Adding comments directly into the source code using :doc:`Doxygen <../developer_tools/doxygen>`

2. Writing brief descriptions of code features for publication here, in the :doc:`JEDI Documentation <../../index>`.
This is achieved by means of a python package called :doc:`Sphinx <../developer_tools/getting-started-with-sphinx>`.
You can find more details about creating documentation `here <../../working-practices/creating-docs.html>`_

Please follow the links above for more information on how to write documentation for use with both Doxygen and Sphinx.
