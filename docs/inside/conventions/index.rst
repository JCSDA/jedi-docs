JEDI Data Conventions
#####################

The **JEDI Observation Conventions** standardize the format of observation data to promote the processing and sharing of files produced by the JEDI system. These conventions aim to greatly enhance interoperability and reusability within JEDI, particularly for long-term storage and reanalysis. The conventions also facilitate building applications with powerful extraction and display capabilities.

We will work with the geoscience community to expand these conventions to new instruments, and we expect frequent updates. In the coming months, we will implement changes to underlying data files and codes in UFO, ioda-converters, and any other repositories as needed to match these conventions. Changes will occur in stages, using code sprints for rapid implementation, and will involve the entire JCSDA community.
