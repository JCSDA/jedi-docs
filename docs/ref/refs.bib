abstract = {Abstract In any statistical data assimilation scheme the ratio between the observation and background errors fundamentally determines the weight given to the observations. The observation errors are specified directly in terms of the observable quantities. In variational data assimilation schemes these can include satellite-measured radiances as well as conventional observations. The background errors, on the other hand, are specified in terms of those quantities that lead to a compact formulation of the background term (the Jb of the variational analysis), viz. balanced vorticity, unbalanced temperature, divergence and surface pressure, and specific humidity. It is not obvious how the magnitudes of these background errors can be compared with the various observation errors. Within the variational analysis, the background errors are implied in terms of observed quantities, i.e. not normally computed explicitly. They depend, in general, on the Jb formulation and on the observation operators. In the case of radiance observations this involves the Jacobian of the radiative-transfer model which, in turn, depends on the atmospheric state. By applying the observation operators of a variational data assimilation scheme to a set of random vectors, drawn from a population whose probability density function is given by the assumed background-error covariance matrix, we obtain grid-point fields of background-error standard deviations for any observed quantity. These are valuable for diagnosing the response of the data assimilation system to observational data, and for tuning the specified observation and background errors in general. The calculated error standard deviations can be compared with those obtained from studies of innovation statistics (i.e. observed departures from the background). The technique has been applied to a range of observable quantities, including the radiance data from both the infrared and microwave instruments of the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS). We used the results for some of the higher-peaking channels to verify that the specified background errors in the recently introduced 50-level version of the ECMWF model are also reasonable in the upper stratosphere, where there are few conventional data. We also found that the operational background errors for humidity were set unrealistically large in some dry subtropical areas. A case of poor convergence of the variational analysis was found to be due to unrealistically high background errors in terms of one of the humidity-sensitive radiance channels (the Meteosat water-vapour channel, similar to TOVS channel 12). Excessively large ratios between background and observation errors locally led to larger than normal eigenvalues of the analysis Hessian—thus increasing the condition number of the minimization problem, with an associated decrease in the rate of convergence of the minimization. The mis-specification of background errors was confined to relatively small areas in the subtropics, but it affected the minimization globally.},

@article{errera2012spectral,
abstract = {Abstract. The formulation of the background error covariances represented in the spectral space is discussed in the context of univariate assimilation relying on a grid point model, leaving out all the aspects of balances between the different control variables needed in meteorological assimilation. The spectral transform operations are discussed in the case of a spherical harmonics basis and we stress that there is no need for an inverse spectral transform and of a Gaussian grid. The analysis increments are thus produced directly on the model grid. The practice of producing analysis increments on a horizontal Gaussian grid and then interpolating to an equally spaced grid is also shown to produce a degradation of the analysis. The method discussed in this paper allows the implementation of separable and non-separable spatial correlations. The separable formulation has been implemented in the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE) and its impact on the assimilation of O3 observed by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) is shown. To promote the use of this method by other non-meteorological variational systems and in particular chemistry, the Fortran code developed is made available to the community.},

abstract = {Abstract Radiance bias correction is an important and necessary step in the proper use of satellite observations in a data assimilation system. The original radiance bias-correction scheme used in the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system consists of two components: a variational air-mass dependent component and a scan-angle component. The air-mass component is updated within the GSI, while the scan-angle component is updated outside the GSI. This study examines and enhances several aspects of the radiance bias-correction problem. First, a modified pre-conditioning is applied to the bias-correction coefficients and the analysis variables to speed up convergence of the minimization process. A new procedure for applying the modified pre-conditioning in the GSI is utilized. Second, capabilities for detecting any new/missing/recovering radiance data and initializing the bias correction for new radiance data are implemented. A new scheme is proposed and employed to adjust the background-error variances for the bias-correction coefficients automatically, using an approximation of the analysis-error variances from the previous cycle, and to remove the pre-specified predictor scaling parameters. Finally, the capability to perform bias correction for passive channels within the GSI is developed with a new approach. The two-step bias-correction procedure originally used is replaced with a one-step variational bias-correction scheme within the GSI. Experiment results with the GSI-based hybrid ensemble-variational system show that using the modified pre-conditioning leads to a better convergence rate. Moreover, with the one-step scheme, the anomaly correlation of geopotential height at 500 mb is neutral in the Northern Hemisphere but improved in the Southern Hemisphere. The root-mean-square (RMS) error of wind is comparable to that of the two-step scheme and the biases of the global temperature 24 h and 48 h forecasts fitted to the rawinsonde are reduced.},
