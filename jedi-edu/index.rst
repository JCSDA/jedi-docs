Welcome to JEDI-EDU!

JEDI is a unified and versatile **data assimilation (DA)** system for Earth System Prediction.  The JEDI software package can be run on a variety of platforms from laptops to supercomputers, for a variety of purposes, from teaching and learning DA fundamentals to the development and validation of new DA algorithms and observational operators, to leading-edge atmospheric and oceanic research, to operational weather forecasting.  It is designed to readily accommodate new atmospheric and oceanic models and new observation systems.

JEDI is developed and distributed by the `Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation <https://jcsda.org>`_, a `multi-agency <https://jcsda.org/partners>`_ research center hosted by `the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) <https://www.ucar.edu>`_. JCSDA is dedicated to improving and accelerating the quantitative use of research and operational satellite data in weather, ocean, climate and environmental analysis and prediction systems.

If you have questions about the JEDI project, JEDI usage, JEDI components, or this document, please `visit our forums <https://forums.jcsda.org>`_.
